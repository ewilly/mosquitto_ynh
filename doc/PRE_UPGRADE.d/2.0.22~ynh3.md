This new version comes with plain MQTT by default (traditionally on port 1883).
If you need to change from plain MQTT to secure MQTT (over TLS / over WebSockets) just go to the config panel to change.

This new version offers a config panel, which allow to change:

 - the protocol : plain MQTT vs secure MQTT (over TLS / over WebSockets)

 - the mqtt username and/or password
